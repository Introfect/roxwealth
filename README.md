## Run Locally

Clone the project

  git clone https://github.com/Introfect/zaillex.git
```

Go to the project directory

open to terminals and navigate inside client and server folders seperately 


Install dependencies

Firstly you need to install jsonserver in your system to run the dummy server

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

now instal the dependency for the react application
```bash
  npm i --force
```
Run the server before the react application, json file is alteady in the project repo run 

```bash
json-server db.json
```

I have added the google maps api key in the code itself for avoiding problems while setting on your devices

Start the server use the command

```bash
  npm start
```
